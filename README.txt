TR52MC repository contents:

There are two KiCad projects, one for the internal PCB (pulseremote), one for the front panel (richardpanel).

Suggest the user downloads all these files, extracts them to a single directory then uses the KiCad PCB viewer to open the relevant files from the correct directory.
